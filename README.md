## Full Project Idea
This project demonstrates a basic Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a web application and integrates Artificial Intelligence to automatically explain the vulnerability and suggest secure fixes. The system allows a user to input data into a deliberately vulnerable web page. When a malicious script executes, the application sends details of the input and behavior to an AI model, which then generates a human-readable explanation of what type of XSS occurred, why it happened and how developers can fix it.
