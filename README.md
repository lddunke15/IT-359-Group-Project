## Full Project Idea
This project demonstrates a basic Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a web application and integrates Artificial Intelligence to automatically explain the vulnerability and suggest secure fixes. The system allows a user to input data into a deliberately vulnerable web page. When a malicious script executes, the application sends details of the input and behavior to an AI model, which then generates a human-readable explanation of what type of XSS occurred, why it happened and how developers can fix it.

We will be using one intentionally vulnerable web page to demonstrate with, AI to generate explanations and common XSS payloads to test in our web page. We will be using an html web page and javaScript to make our webpage, and the School of IT's AI bot to generate the responses.
